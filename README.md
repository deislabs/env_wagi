# env_wagi: Example WAGI program

_WAGI is the easiest way to get started doing cloud-side WASM web apps._

WAGI (Web Assembly Gateway Interface) is an adaptation of CGI for WebAssembly WASI modules. This example uses the [WAGI server](https://github.com/deislabs/wagi).

This repo contains a Rust implementation of a WAGI program that shows off the basic WAGI features.

## Building

You can test the output of this command using `cargo run`.

However, when building it for WAGI, you need to compile this as Web Assembly with WASI support:

```
$ rustup target add wasm32-wasi # You only need to do this once to install the wasm32-wasi compiler
$ cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release
```

(We recommend using `--release` because it considerably reduces the size.)

The resulting binary will be written to `target/wasm32-wasi/release/hello_wagi.wasm`.

## The `modules.toml` Settings

For this module to work, your `module.toml` should look like this:

```toml
[[module]]
# Mount this to example.com/env
route = "/env"
# Point to the directory that 'cargo build' wrote the WASM file
module = "/path/to/env_wagi/target/wasm32-wasi/release/env_wagi.wasm"
# Mount the source code of this repo
volumes = { "/" = "/path/to/env_wagi" }
# Set an environment variable
environment.TEST_NAME = "test value"
```

Note that the `volumes` mounts this source code repo to the `/` of the WASM runtime. We use this to list files, and also to read the contents of the `LICENSE.txt` file.

### Using Curl to Execute

Here is an example using `curl` to access `localhost:3000` and also override the `HOST` header. The `-vvv` flag sets Curl's verbosity level.

```console
$ curl -vvv -H "HOST:foo.example.com" localhost:3000/env?greet=matt\&foo=bar
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 3000 (#0)
> GET /env?greet=matt&foo=bar HTTP/1.1
> Host:foo.example.com
> User-Agent: curl/7.64.1
> Accept: */*
>
